## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and hands-on cybersecurity professional with a Master’s in Computer Science & Cybersecurity from Harrisburg University. I specialize in **Security Operations (SOC)**, **Threat Detection**, **Incident Response**, and **Cloud Security (AWS & Office 365)**.

During my academic journey and freelance work (2020–2021), I’ve built a strong technical foundation through self-initiated projects, real-world simulations, and teaching cybersecurity concepts.

I love working with **SIEM (Splunk)**, scripting in **Python/Bash**, and analyzing logs to catch bad actors before they strike. 🚀
